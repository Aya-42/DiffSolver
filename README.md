# Overview

This repo is part of an assignment for the HPC course at UTD. This assignment involves implementing the Euler method to solve a specific ODE, exploring the effects of step size on the solution’s accuracy, and optimizing the implementation for performance using Python’s advanced numerical and parallel computing libraries.
